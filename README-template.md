### What I learned

I've been working primarly as a Back End Developer lately so there were a few things that I had to remember how to do.

1. How to add Google Fonts to a project:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

2. How to use the `box-shadow` property:

```css
--box-shadow: 0 1rem 2rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
```

3. And how to center a `div` using `grid`:

```css
display: grid;
place-items: center;
```

### Continued development

I want to build bigger projects using a Front End Framework like React to try out some different ways to handle styles.

I've been practicing CSS for the first time since I originally learned the basics and, now as a more experienced developer, I'm concerned with how to handle CSS in larger teams. Utility classes and custom properties are amazing but I can see
how adding those can also bring a ton of overhead. Something as simple as maintaining naming conventions would already be a nightmare.

So I'm thinking about trying something like Tailwind CSS. How it works barely matters, what I'm really interested in is that it is a simple, homogeneous and well documented system for styling applications.
